$ docker login

The quickest way to get started is using docker-compose.

$ cd redmine
$ docker-compose up -d

Figure out the ip address of Docker host. If you're running Linux, it's just localhost, or 127.0.0.1. If you're using Docker Machine on Mac or Windows, you'll need to run:
$ docker-machine ip default

Point your browser to http://localhost:10083 and login using the default username and password:
-username: admin
-password: admin
